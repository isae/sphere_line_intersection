=========================

Practice task in the course of computational geometry.
Sphere lines intersections with test and visualizer.
Tests were made using google`s gtest library
I have used <a href="https://github.com/khovanskiy/" title="khovanskiy`s"> <a href="https://github.com/khovanskiy/Geometry2">Geometry2</a> as a visualizer.
