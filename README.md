sphere-line-intersection-
=========================

Practice task in the course of computational geometry.
Sphere lines intersections with test and visualizer.
Tests were made using google`s gtest library
I have used [khovanskiy`s](https://github.com/khovanskiy/) <a href="https://github.com/khovanskiy/Geometry2">Geometry2</a> as a visualizer.
